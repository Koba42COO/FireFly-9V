🛠️ How Firefly AI Works

Firefly AI is multi-layered and self-evolving, powered by four core AI modules working together:
1️⃣ AVA AI – Conversational AI & Data Analysis
2️⃣ Sentinel AI – Cybersecurity & Language Decoding
3️⃣ GrokMath AI – Recursive Mathematics & Theorem Generation
4️⃣ Quantum AI – Quantum Computing & Dimensional Intelligence

💡 Firefly learns from you and adjusts over time. It operates locally on your system with full privacy and no cloud dependencies.
